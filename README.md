Allison's Finals Week Reactions:
This finals week has not been near as stressful or demanding as previous semesters. My finals have been mostly project-based and have already been turned in. My semester has been a fairly easy one, and I'm confident I will finish with good grades. That being said, I am absolutely ready to wrap it up and enjoy my last summer before real adulthood. :blush:


After turning in this exam, I will:
* Drink a glass of wine :wine_glass:
* Make notecards for my final on Thursday :pencil:
* Begin packing my apartment to move into my new house! :house:
